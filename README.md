## User Story
AS AN employer</br>
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples</br>
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position</br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work</br>
WHEN I load their portfolio</br>
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them</br>
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation</br>
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section</br>
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work</br>
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications</br>
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application</br>
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others</br>
WHEN I click on the images of the applications</br>
THEN I am taken to that deployed application</br>
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices</br>
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport</br>
